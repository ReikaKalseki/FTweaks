tiered-bob-robots=Make each BobMod robot part require the previous tier


[mod-setting-description]
bigger-stacks=If true raw materials (ore, plates etc) stack to 200.
cheap-steel=Bobplates-style; reduces cost to 2 iron per steel and halves smelt time.
harder-silo=Makes the rocket silo much harder both in terms of research and resources.
manual-silo=Forces manual-only crafting of rocket silos. Only meaningful with the Harder Silo option enabled.
harder-nuclear=Greatly increases the technology progression required to research nuclear reactors.
harder-rockets=Makes the rocket launches more difficult by making the resultant noise SERIOUSLY upset the local wildlife.
tiered-armor=Makes the armor progression more natural; also makes each stage require the previous so that old armor still has value.
smaller-trees=This halves the size of tree hitboxes, allowing easier placement of entities around them.
wood-sludging=This controls two oil-processing recipes to convert wood - raw and planks - into oil products.
advanced-satellite=Should a tier-2 research satellite be obtainable? It has a higher space science yield per rocket (and per rocket cost), but costs far more to create.
sane-concrete=Whether to replace the iron ore in the concrete recipe with iron sticks, which is both more friendly to factory setups and more realistic.
tech-demultiply=The factor by which to decrease the costs of a few entry-level technologies (eg Automation I) so that high-difficulty saves do not force the manual crafting of hundreds of science packs before they can begin to be automated. Usually equal to the technology price multipler.
split-gun-turret=Whether to split the gun turret recipe into a more-expensive-but-faster-to-craft manual version (for making early game defences less painful to build), and a slightly-cheaper-but slower version for assemblers.
split-red-science=Whether to split the red science pack recipe into a more-expensive-but-faster-to-craft manual version (for making the first research into automation less painful), and a slightly-cheaper-but slower version for assemblers.
tiered-bob-robots=If enabled, this changes the recipes for BobMod robot parts - frames, tools, and robot brains - so that each tier is crafted from the previous tier plus the difference in cost in original recipes (eg if T4 costs 4 CPUs and 6 transitors, and T3 0 CPUs and 2 Transistors, the T4 will now cost 4 CPUs, 4 Transitors, and a T3).
