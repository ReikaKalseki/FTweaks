[mod-setting-description]
bigger-stacks=If true raw materials (ore, plates etc) stack to 200.
cheap-steel=Bobplates-style; reduces cost to 2 iron per steel and halves smelt time.
cheap-landfill=Reduces landfill stone cost to the specified fraction.
harder-silo=Makes the rocket silo much harder both in terms of research and resources.
manual-silo=Forces manual-only crafting of rocket silos. Only meaningful with the Harder Silo option enabled.
harder-nuclear=Greatly increases the technology progression required to research nuclear reactors.
harder-rockets=Makes the rocket launches more difficult by making the resultant noise SERIOUSLY upset the local wildlife.
tiered-armor=Makes the armor progression more natural; also makes each stage require the previous so that old armor still has value.
smaller-trees=This halves the size of tree hitboxes, allowing easier placement of entities around them.
wood-sludging=This controls two oil-processing recipes to convert wood - raw and planks - into oil products.
coal-decomposition=This controls a recipe to break down coal into its chemical constituents - carbon, sulfur, and hydrogen. Only works when those items/fluids exist.
advanced-satellite=Should a tier-2 research satellite be obtainable? It has a higher space science yield per rocket (and per rocket cost), but costs far more to create.
sane-concrete=Whether to replace the iron ore in the concrete recipe with iron sticks, which is both more friendly to factory setups and more realistic.
tech-demultiply=The factor by which to decrease the costs of a few entry-level technologies (eg Automation I) so that high-difficulty saves do not force the manual crafting of hundreds of science packs before they can begin to be automated. Usually equal to the technology price multipler.
split-gun-turret=Whether to split the gun turret recipe into a more-expensive-but-faster-to-craft manual version (for making early game defences less painful to build), and a slightly-cheaper-but slower version for assemblers.
split-red-science=Whether to split the red science pack recipe into a more-expensive-but-faster-to-craft manual version (for making the first research into automation less painful), and a slightly-cheaper-but slower version for assemblers.
tiered-bob-robots=If enabled, this changes the recipes for BobMod robot parts - frames, tools, and robot brains - so that each tier is crafted from the previous tier plus the difference in cost in original recipes (eg if T4 costs 4 CPUs and 6 transitors, and T3 0 CPUs and 2 Transistors, the T4 will now cost 4 CPUs, 4 Transitors, and a T3).
cheaper-belts=BobMods integration; Makes the blue, green, and purple belts use fewer gears and bearings (just count, not type) to avoid each unit of belt costing hundreds of units of material. Additionally, if logistic science packs exist (which contain a blue belt in their recipe), this option prevents technologies using it from being extraordinarily expensive to research.
logistics-pipes=Whether to add one unit of iron pipe to the green (logistic) science pack recipe. This was an idea raised in FFF #275 and never actually implemented.
demultiply-upgrades=Whether to apply the "tech demultiply" behavior to "pure upgrade" technologies like bullet damage, train braking force, and lab speed
invincible-drones=Useful given their tendency to run off into biter swarms.
better-artillery=Whether to make artillery stronger, to compensate for things like wider pollution spread, stronger nests, or more aggressive biter expansion. Increases both range and damage per shot.
bob-gem-efficiency=What fraction of the raw gem input is successfully processed into a cut gem.
